abstract: ' Biomedical imaging, especially molecular imaging, has been a driving force
  in scientific discovery, technological innovation, and precision medicine in the
  past two decades. While substantial advances and discoveries in chemical biology
  have been made to develop molecular imaging probes and tracers, translating these
  exogenous agents to clinical application in precision medicine is a major challenge.
  Among the clinically accepted imaging modalities, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
  and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) exemplify the most effective and robust
  biomedical imaging tools. Both MRI and MRS enable a broad range of chemical, biological
  and clinical applications from determining molecular structures in biochemical analysis
  to imaging diagnosis and characterization of many diseases and image-guided interventions.
  Using chemical, biological, and nuclear magnetic resonance properties of specific
  endogenous metabolites and native MRI contrast-enhancing biomolecules, label-free
  molecular and cellular imaging with MRI can be achieved in biomedical research and
  clinical management of patients with various diseases. This review article outlines
  the chemical and biological bases of several label-free chemically and molecularly
  selective MRI and MRS methods that have been applied in imaging biomarker discovery,
  preclinical investigation, and image-guided clinical management. Examples are provided
  to demonstrate strategies for using endogenous probes to report the molecular, metabolic,
  physiological, and functional events and processes in living systems, including
  patients. Future perspectives on label-free molecular MRI and its challenges as
  well as potential solutions, including the use of rational design and engineered
  approaches to develop chemical and biological imaging probes to facilitate or combine
  with label-free molecular MRI, are discussed. '
