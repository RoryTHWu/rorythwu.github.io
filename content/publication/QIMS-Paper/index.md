abstract: Drug development must comply with relevant regulatory requirements and be guided by the relevant guidances for industry developed by regulatory agencies, with reference to relevant use cases developed by regulatory agencies. The approval of a new drug must be based on evidence from clinical trials. With the continuous development of the biopharmaceutical industry, the complexity of clinical trials has increased. Relying solely on increasing investment is hard to improve clinical trial efficiency, and solving the problems of low pipeline productivity and high costs. This paper explores the application and regulation challenges of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) in clinical trials by analyzing the viewpoints of FDA discussion paper and EMA reflection paper and stakeholdersâ€™ comments.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this paper, we reviewed the recent development of Label-Free Chemically and Molecularly Selective Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
